# Fluxifyed
A powerful, multi-purpose and feature-rich Discord bot designed to be very customizable and easy-to-use.

## Commands
Fluxifyed uses Discord's slash commands, which allows for easier customization of permissions and allowed channels. A full list of commands can be found on the [website](https://fluxifyed.foxes4life.net/commands).

Most common permissions (Send Messages, Attach Files, etc.) arent required when using slash commands, but if the bot requires an extra permission the user will be notified.

## Adding the bot
The bot can be added using [this](https://fluxifyed.foxes4life.net/invite) link. This will only add it with the required permissions as giving bots the Administrator permission is not a good idea. (this counts for any bot)
